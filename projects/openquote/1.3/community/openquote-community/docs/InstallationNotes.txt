OpenQuote Service Pack - Installation Notes
===========================================

Welcome to OpenQuote @major.version@.@minor.version@@increment.version@, and thank you for your 
interest in this project.

The notes included here are intended to get you up and running with OpenQuote
in the shortest possible time; around 10 minutes if you already have the
prerequisites installed. 

Beyond this basic configuration there are a host of other more detailed 
customizations that are possible; some of which would be considered necessary
before you think about using OpenQuote in a production environment. These will
be covered later and elsewhere, for now this will be enough to get you off the 
ground.

Note: You will need to be happy working from a command line to complete the
installation. If you're not, consider taking a look at our online demo at
http://ail-ltd.com:8080/portal

There is no automated process to upgrade the installation of previous versions
of OpenQuote, but there are some notes at the end of this file which you may 
find helpful.

Prerequisites
=============

- Java Development Kit (aka J2SE SDK) available from http://java.sun.com
- MySql Database available from http://www.mysql.com

Installing the Java Development Kit
===================================

- Browse to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads.
- Select the appropriate J2SE download for your environment, making sure it
  is J2SE 5.0 or 6.0.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard.

Installing MySql
================

- Browse to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads.
- Select the appropriate download for your environment. You will need 
  version 4.1 or higher.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard - as part of this you will
  be prompted to select a password. You will need this later on.
  
Installing OpenQuote
====================

OpenQuote community is supplied as a zip file. Simply unpack this zip file
and follow the instructions below (described under Starting the OpenQuote 
server).

If you are installing on Windows, we recommend that you don't use Window's
built-in zip file viewer. A number of issues have been reported on the 
forums which seem to point at file corruption caused by the build-in tool.
We recommend that you use winzip, unrar, or jar to unpack the .zip. 

Note: If you are installing OpenQuote for use with Java J2SE 6.0, you also
need to copy the following files from the openquote-community/jboss/client 
directory to the openquote-community/jboss/lib/endorsed directory:
          o jboss-jaxrpc.jar
          o jboss-jaxws.jar
          o jboss-saaj.jar
          o jaxb-api.jar 

Starting the OpenQuote server
=============================

Command scripts are supplied which should be suitable for MS Windows, and Unix
users. From the command prompt, cd into openquote-community/bin, then either 
execute run.sh on Unix, or run.bat on MS Windows.

The first time you run OpenQuote it will automatically setup your environment
for you. Most importantly, it will create and populate a database in MySQL.
During the setup process, you will be prompted for the database password.
At that prompt enter the MySql root password (the password supplied during
MySql installation.)
  
Depending on the spec of your machine the server may take one or two minutes
to start up. It will output progress messages as it starts. Start up is complete
when you see a line like this:

INFO  [Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [4.2.2.GA (build: SVNTag=JBoss_4_2_2_GA 
date=200710221139)] Started in 1m:41s:308ms

Accessing OpenQuote
===================

Once the server is running, you can access OpenQuote by pointing your browser
at http://localhost:8080/portal

Stopping the OpenQuote server
=============================

Either closing the command prompt window, or hitting CTRL-C will close the 
server down cleanly.

Trouble shooting
================

If you have any issues during installation, or while you are using OpenQuote, 
the best place to start looking for information is in our project forum here: 
http://openquote.opensourceinsurance.org/index.php/support/support-forum and 
feel free to post a question if you can't find the answer you need.

If you believe you have found one please check our bug tracker. However, do 
please search carefully first, and only look at raising a new bug if you are 
sure your particular problem is not already covered. The bug tracker can be 
found here: http://openquotecommunity.org/jira 

Upgrading from earlier versions
===============================

Installing this release of OpenQuote will not in any way affect any existing 
installations of older versions. Follow the installation guidelines outlined 
in this file will result in a completely new and independent installation with
its own server and database.

You will not be able to run both installations at the same time as they use
same port numbers, but you will be able to start and stop them independently.

Quote data can be moved between the systems using SQL. There are only two 
tables concerned: saved_quote and saved_quote_summary. The easiest way to move
these is to use MySQL's mysqldump command. Documentation can be found here: 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysqldump.html

Products can be exported from the old system and imported into the new 
installation using Alfresco's built in import/export facility. A description
of those tools can be found here: 
http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Export_and_Import#Web_Client_Export_.26_Import_of_Folders_.26_Files

Once imported into the new system you will need to register the products there.
The "Registering a Product" section in the OpenQuote 1.2 User Guide explains 
this process. You'll find a copy of this guide in the same folder as these notes.
