 This file defines the default (factory) configuration for the
 AddPolicyNumber Service. This configuration is used by the entry point's
 resetConfiguration() method.
 This configuration doesn't represent a real live configuration. This
 is only the core service and as such it doesn't define any product
 rules. For these you have to look at the specialisations that use this
 service.
