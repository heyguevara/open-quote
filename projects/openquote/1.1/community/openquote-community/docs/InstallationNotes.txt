OpenQuote Release Candidate - Installation Notes
================================================

Welcome to OpenQuote @major.version@.@minor.version@@increment.version@, and thank you for your 
interest in this project.

The notes included here are intended to get you up and running with OpenQuote
in the shortest possible time; around 10 minutes if you already have the
prerequisites installed. 

Beyond this basic configuration there are a host of other more detailed 
customizations that are possible; some of which would be considered necessary
before you think about using OpenQuote in a production environment. These will
be covered later and elsewhere, for now this will be enough to get you off the 
ground.

Note: You will need to be happy working from a command line to complete the
installation. If you're not, consider taking a look at our online demo at
http://ail-ltd.com:8080/portal

There is no automated process to upgrade the installation of previous version
of OpenQuote, but there are some notes at the end of this file which you may 
find helpful.

Prerequisites
=============

- Java Development Kit (aka J2SE SDK) available from http://java.sun.com
- MySql Database available from http://www.mysql.com

Installing the Java Development Kit
===================================

- Browse to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads.
- Select the appropriate J2SE download for your environment, making sure it
  is J2SE 5.0 or 6.0.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard.

Installing MySql
================

- Browse to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads.
- Select the appropriate download for your environment. You will need 
  version 4.1 or higher.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard - as part of this you will
  be prompted to select a password. You will need this later on.
  
Installing OpenQuote
====================

OpenQuote community is supplied as a zip file. Simply unpack this zip file
and follow the instructions below (Installing the OpenQuote database, and
Starting the OpenQuote server).

Note: If you are installing OpenQuote for use with Java J2SE 6.0, you should
also do the following: Manually copy the following files from the  
openquote-community/jboss/client folder to the openquote-community/jboss/lib/endorsed 
directory:
          o jboss-jaxrpc.jar
          o jboss-jaxws.jar
          o jboss-saaj.jar
          o jaxb-api.jar 

Installing the OpenQuote database 
=================================

A script is provided in openquote-community/setup which will create the
necessary database, and populate it. To run the script (make sure you have
MySql running):

From a command prompt, cd into the openquote-community/setup directory and:
  
> mysql -u root -p < MySql-dump.sql
Enter password: 
  
At the prompt enter the MySql root password (the password supplied during
MySql installation.)
  
Starting the OpenQuote server
=============================

Command scripts are supplied which should be suitable for MS Windows, and Unix
users. From the command prompt, cd into openquote-community/jboss/bin, then 
either execute run.sh on Unix, or run.bat on MS Windows.

Depending on the spec of your machine the server may take one of two minutes
to start up. It will output progress messages as it starts. Start up is complete
when you see a line like this:

INFO  [Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [4.2.2.GA (build: SVNTag=JBoss_4_2_2_GA 
date=200710221139)] Started in 1m:41s:308ms

Accessing OpenQuote
===================

Once the server is running, you can access OpenQuote by pointing your browser
at http://localhost:8080/portal

Stopping the OpenQuote server
=============================

Either closing the command prompt window, or hitting CTRL-C will close the 
server down cleanly.

Trouble shooting
================

If you have any issues during installation, or while you are using OpenQuote, 
the best place to start looking for information is in our new forum here: 
http://openquote.opensourceinsurance.org/index.php/support/support-forum
(and our old forums here: http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=215808) and 
feel free to post a question if you can't find the answer you need.

As this is an EA release, we do anticipate there being bugs. If you believe
you have found one please check our bug tracker. However, do please search 
carefully first, and only look at raising a new bug if you are sure your 
particular problem is not already covered. The bug tracker can be found 
here: http://openquotecommunity.org/jira 

Upgrading from earlier versions
===============================

Installing this release of OpenQuote will not in any way affect any existing 
installations of older versions. Follow the installation guidelines outlined 
in the file will result in a completely new and independent installation with
its own server and database.

You will not be able to run both installations at the same time as they use
same port numbers, but you will be able to start and stop them independently.

Quote data can be moved between the systems using SQL. There are only two 
tables concerned: saved_quote and saved_quote_summary. The easiest way to move
these is using MySQL's mysqldump command. Documentation can be found here: 
<URL NEEDED!>

Products can be exported from the old system and imported into the new 
installation using Alfresco's built in import/export facility. A description
of those tools can be found here: <URL NEEDED>
Once imported into the new system you will need to register the products there.
The "Registering a Product" section in the OpenQuote 1.0 User Guide (you'll
find it in the same folder as these notes) explains this process.
