	<h1>OpenQuote 2.0 Early Access 1 - Installation Notes</h1>
	<p>Welcome to OpenQuote 2.0 EA1, and thank you for your interest in
		this project.</p>
	<p>The notes included here are intended to get you up and running
		with OpenQuote in the shortest possible time; around 10 minutes if you
		already have the prerequisites installed.</p>
	<p>Beyond this basic configuration there are a host of other more
		detailed customizations that are possible; some of which would be
		considered necessary before you think about using OpenQuote in a
		production environment. These will be covered later and elsewhere, for
		now this will be enough to get you off the ground.</p>
	<p>
		Note: You will need to be happy working from a command line to
		complete the installation. If you're not, consider taking a look at
		our <a
			href="http://ec2-46-137-2-77.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/portal">online
			demo</a> instead.
	</p>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Java 6 Development Kit (aka Java SE) available from Oracle
			or other sources depending on your platform.</li>
		<li>MySql Database server.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Installing the Java Development Kit</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Browse to <a
			href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk6downloads-1902814.html">Java
				6 downloads</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Select the appropriate Java SE download for your environment,
			making sure it is Java SE 6.0, OpenQuote is not currently compatible
			with 7.0.</li>
		<li>Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Installing MySql</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Browse to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Select the appropriate download for your environment. You
			will need version 5.1 or later.</li>
		<li>Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard - as part of
			this you will be prompted to select a password. You will need this
			later on.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Installing OpenQuote</h2>
	<p>OpenQuote community is supplied as a zip file. Simply unpack
		this zip file and follow the instructions below (described under
		Starting the OpenQuote server).</p>
	<p>If you are installing on Windows, we recommend that you don't
		use Window's built-in zip file viewer. A number of issues have been
		reported on the forums which seem to point at file corruption caused
		by the build-in tool. We recommend that you use winzip, unrar, or jar
		to unpack the .zip.</p>

	<h2>Starting the OpenQuote server</h2>
	<p>Command scripts are supplied which should be suitable for MS
		Windows, and Unix users. From the command prompt, cd into
		openquote/bin, then either execute run.sh on Unix, or run.bat on MS
		Windows.</p>
	<p>The first time you run OpenQuote it will automatically setup
		your environment for you. Most importantly, it will create and
		populate a database in MySQL. During the setup process, you will be
		prompted for the database password. At that prompt enter the MySql
		root password (the password supplied during MySql installation.)</p>
	<p>Depending on the spec. of your machine the server may take one
		or two minutes to start up. It will output progress messages as it
		starts. Start up is complete when a browser window opens showing the
		OpenQuote home page.</p>
	<h2>Accessing OpenQuote</h2>
	<p>
		Once the server is running, you can access OpenQuote by pointing your
		browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>
	</p>
	<h2>Stopping the OpenQuote server</h2>
	<p>Either closing the command prompt window, or hitting CTRL-C will
		close the server down cleanly.</p>
	<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>
	<p>
		If you have any issues during installation, or while you are using
		OpenQuote, the best place to start looking for information is in our
		project forum <a
			href="http://openquote.opensourceinsurance.org/index.php/support/support-forum">project
			forum</a>, and feel free to post a question if you can't find the answer
		you need.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you believe you have found a bug please check our <a
			href="http://openquotecommunity.org/jira">bug tracker</a>. However,
		do please search carefully first, and only look at raising a new bug
		if you are sure your particular problem is not already covered.
