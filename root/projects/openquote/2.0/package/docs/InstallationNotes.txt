OpenQuote 2.0 Early Access 1 - Installation Notes
=================================================

Welcome to OpenQuote 2.0 EA1, and thank you for your interest in this project.

The notes included here are intended to get you up and running with OpenQuote
in the shortest possible time; around 10 minutes if you already have the
prerequisites installed. 

Beyond this basic configuration there are a host of other more detailed 
customizations that are possible; some of which would be considered necessary
before you think about using OpenQuote in a production environment. These will
be covered later and elsewhere, for now this will be enough to get you off the 
ground.

Note: You will need to be happy working from a command line to complete the
installation. If you're not, consider taking a look at our online demo at

Prerequisites
=============

- Java Development Kit (aka J2SE SDK) available from http://java.sun.com
- MySql Database available from http://www.mysql.com

Installing the Java Development Kit
===================================

- Browse to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads.
- Select the appropriate J2SE download for your environment, making sure it
  is J2SE 6.0.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard.

Installing MySql
================

- Browse to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads.
- Select the appropriate download for your environment. You will need 
  version 5.1 or later.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard - as part of this you will
  be prompted to select a password. You will need this later on.
  
Installing OpenQuote
====================

OpenQuote community is supplied as a zip file. Simply unpack this zip file
and follow the instructions below (described under Starting the OpenQuote 
server).

If you are installing on Windows, we recommend that you don't use Window's
built-in zip file viewer. A number of issues have been reported on the 
forums which seem to point at file corruption caused by the build-in tool.
We recommend that you use winzip, unrar, or jar to unpack the .zip. 

Starting the OpenQuote server
=============================

Command scripts are supplied which should be suitable for MS Windows, and Unix
users. From the command prompt, cd into openquote-community/bin, then either 
execute run.sh on Unix, or run.bat on MS Windows.

The first time you run OpenQuote it will automatically setup your environment
for you. Most importantly, it will create and populate a database in MySQL.
During the setup process, you will be prompted for the database password.
At that prompt enter the MySql root password (the password supplied during
MySql installation.)
  
Depending on the spec. of your machine the server may take one or two minutes
to start up. It will output progress messages as it starts. Start up is complete
when a browser window opens showing the OpenQuote home page.

Accessing OpenQuote
===================

Once the server is running, you can access OpenQuote by pointing your browser
at http://localhost:8080

Stopping the OpenQuote server
=============================

Either closing the command prompt window, or hitting CTRL-C will close the 
server down cleanly.

Trouble shooting
================

If you have any issues during installation, or while you are using OpenQuote, 
the best place to start looking for information is in our project forum here:
