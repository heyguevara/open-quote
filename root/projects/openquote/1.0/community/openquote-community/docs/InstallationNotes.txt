OpenQuote - Installation Notes
==============================

Welcome to OpenQuote @major.version@.@minor.version@@candidate.version@, and thank you for your interest in this project.

The notes included here are intended to get you up and running with OpenQuote
in the shortest possible time; around 10 minutes if you already have the
prerequisites installed. 

Beyond this basic configuration there are a host of other more detailed 
customizations that are possible; some of which would be considered necessary
before you think about using OpenQuote in a production environment. These will be
covered later and elsewhere, for now this will be enough to get you off the 
ground.

Note: You will need to be happy working from a command line to complete the
installation. If you're not, consider taking a look at our online demo at
http://ail-ltd.com:8080/portal

Prerequisites
=============

- Java Development Kit (aka J2SE SDK) available from http://java.sun.com
- MySql Database available from http://www.mysql.com

Installing the Java Development Kit
===================================

- Browse to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads.
- Select the appropriate J2SE download for your environment, making sure it
  is J2SE 5.0 or 6.0.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard.

Installing MySql
================

- Browse to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads.
- Select the appropriate download for your environment. You will need 
  version 4.1 or higher.
- Once downloaded, follow the installation wizard - as part of this you will
  be prompted to select a password. You will need this later on.
  
Installing the OpenQuote database 
=================================

A script is provided in openquote-community/setup which will create the
necessary database, and populate it. To run the script (make sure you have
MySql running):

From a command prompt, cd into the openquote-community/setup directory and:
  
> mysql -u root -p < MySql-dump.sql
Enter password: 
  
At the prompt enter the MySql root password (the password supplied during
MySql installation.)
  
Starting the OpenQuote server
=============================

Command scripts are supplied which should be suitable for MS Windows, and Unix
users. From the command prompt, cd into openquote-community/jboss/bin, then 
either execute run.sh on Unix, or run.bat on MS Windows.

Depending on the spec of your machine the server may take one of two minutes
to start up. It will output progress messages as it starts. Start up is complete
when you see a line like this:

INFO  [Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [4.2.2.GA (build: SVNTag=JBoss_4_2_2_GA 
date=200710221139)] Started in 1m:41s:308ms

Accessing OpenQuote
===================

Once the server is running, you can access OpenQuote by pointing your browser
at http://localhost:8080/portal

Stopping the OpenQuote server
=============================

Either closing the command prompt window, or hitting CTRL-C will close the 
server down cleanly.

Trouble shooting
================

If you have any issues during installation, or while you are using OpenQuote, 
please search our forums (http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=215808) for 
help, and feel free to post a question if you can't find the answer you need.

All software has bugs! If you believe you are lucky enough to have found one
please check our bug tracker. However, do please search carefully first, and 
only look at raising a new bug if you are sure your particular problem is not
already covered. The bug tracker can be found on sourceforge here:
