<table border="0" width="100%"> 	<tbody> 		<tr> 			<td class="portlet-body" height="15"> 			<p>The LifePlus product demonstrates the basics of OpenQuote 			product structure and functionality. As a life insurance product it 			is unrealistically simple, but it does serve as a good starting point 			for those interested in understanding more about OpenQuote.</p> 			<p>You can find the definition of the product, and all of the 			content related to it, in Alfresco in the <font face="courier new,courier">Company 			Home/Product/AIL/Demo/LifePlus</font> space.</p> 			<p>The product has a single Asset (the life insured), a single 			section and rates on just four questions. However, it is complete in 			terms of features. For example, referrals and quotations are handled, 			a quotation document can be requested, broker email notifications are 			issued and payment information is collected.</p> 			</td> 		</tr> 	</tbody> </table>
